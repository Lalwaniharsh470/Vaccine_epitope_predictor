Built with a highly modular architecture, the pipeline automates the complex journey from raw proteomic data—whether provided as a local FASTA file or fetched directly via UniProt IDs—to a finalized, structurally validated vaccine construct. Before any analysis begins, the system enforces scientific rigor through an automated Taxonomy API check, ensuring that the user’s pathogen classification (Bacteria, Virus, Fungi, or Protozoa) aligns precisely with its true biological lineage. Once validated, the pipeline leverages a multi-threaded engine to process protein batches across six distinct strategic workflows, ranging from comprehensive MHC-I, MHC-II, and B-cell epitope mapping to deep-dive safety assessments for toxicity, allergenicity, and human homology.

A defining feature of this pipeline is the unique "filtering funnel" logic implemented in Strategy 5. Unlike traditional methods, this strategy prioritizes clinical safety and efficacy by discarding allergenic or toxic sequences before performing high-cost epitope predictions, ensuring only the most potent "elite" peptides move forward. The workflow reaches its conclusion in Strategy 6, where these identified epitopes are intelligently assembled with specific linkers and adjuvants into a single multi-epitope vaccine construct. This construct is then subjected to state-of-the-art 3D structural modeling using the ESMFold AI engine. To ensure the final vaccine is biologically functional, the pipeline performs a Solvent Accessible Surface Area (SASA) analysis on the resulting 3D model, mathematically verifying that critical epitopes are physically exposed on the protein surface and thus visible to the human immune system. By integrating immune recognition, safety filtration, and 3D structural visibility, the Vaccine Epitope Predictor Pipeline delivers a scientifically robust and clinically safe vaccine candidate ready for laboratory synthesis and experimental testing.
